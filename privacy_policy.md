# Ultimate Alarm Clock 
## Privacy Policy

### First version (2024-06-11)
This application does not store any information that is not needed except for the sole purpose of providing the intended functionality.

If you don't use shared alarms, no data is stored outside your device.

For shared alarms, we need to store the alarm details so we can provide this functionality. We use Google's Firebase for this. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

To ensure timely alarm dismissal for location based alarms, this app requires access to your location. Your location will be accessed in the background at the scheduled alarm time.

We do not share, sell or in any way make available, any information about our users.

The application source code is available on this repository and we guarantee that the APK on the Play Store comes from the published source code, without changes.

Users can compile and run their own binaries.
